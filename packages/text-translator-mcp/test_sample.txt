Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Neural Networks

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes that process information.

Applications

Machine learning has numerous applications including image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.
